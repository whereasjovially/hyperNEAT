	* All: (Starting with version 0.8.4) The lib is now governed by
	the LGPLv3 licence. The corresponding files (LGPLv3.txt and
	GPLv3.txt) have been added to the package.  * All: IMPORTANT! The
	namespace is no longer BoardLib, but "LibBoard" to consistent with
	the Unix/Sourceforge/canonical name of the lib.  * Board: Units
	are now handled. Figures may be draw with dimensions given in
	custom units (multiples of cm, mm, in, or pt).  *
	include/board/Color.h (BoardLib): Color::None replaces Color::none
	for consistency.
